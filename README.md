# Rcode

This is a repository with single file R-scripts and some R tutorials.

## Single file R-scripts
  

Installation of these scripts should be usually done by downloading the R-file
and placing it on a easy to remember place on your filesyste. I prefere to
place such scripts at *~/R/dlib*. That way I can write anywhere in myscripts
something like `source("~/R/dlib/filename.R")` to load the script.

Here an example, the internal workflow to create such plots written with script code from the R file itself:
